# Oldest-business
A guided project on DataCamp exploring a dataset on world's oldest businesses

This project was aimed at getting the world's oldest businesses from the datasets formed from the findings of BusinessFinance.co.uk's research. 4 datasets were formed from the results of the research.
1. The dataset containing the businessess, founded year and country code was imported and displayed, followed by the importation of the dataset containing the country and continent they were founded. 
2. Both datasets were merged into one dataframe to gather better insight on the data. 
3. After analysis on the dataframe, the remaining two datasets were imported and merged and further exploration followed.
 
With all the datasets in one dataframe, an accurate information on what the oldest businesses were, their category, when and where they were founded were obtained.
